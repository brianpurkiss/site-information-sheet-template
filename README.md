A site information sheet is a useful internal document for development agencies. It acts as an archive about all relevant hosting information for a project. This allows people working on the project, new and old, obtain information about the project without having to ask other people and take up their time. 

This is a template site information sheet. Keep actual site information sheets stored in a secure location such as [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), or do not include login information on it.
